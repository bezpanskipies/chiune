          <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Chiune Sugihara's life:</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>1900</strong> – Chiune Sugihara was born on January 1 in Yaotsu, Gifu Prefecture, Japan, into a samurai-descended family.</li>
            <li><strong>1918–1924,</strong> – Studied foreign languages and international relations, becoming fluent in Russian, German, and English; later joined the Japanese Foreign Ministry.</li>
            <li><strong>1939</strong> – Assigned as Vice-Consul to the Japanese Consulate in Kaunas, Lithuania, just as World War II was beginning.</li>
            <li><strong>July 1940</strong> – Began issuing transit visas against direct orders from Tokyo, helping Jewish refugees escape Nazi-occupied Europe via Japan.</li>
            <li><strong>August 1940</strong> – Continued writing visas for long hours each day, even tossing signed documents from the train window as he was forced to leave Lithuania.</li>
            <li><strong>1941–1946</strong> – Returned to Japan and was later held by the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war for over a year after the war ended.</li>
            <li><strong>1947</strong> – Dismissed from the Japanese Foreign Ministry, possibly due to his defiance during the war; he spent the following decades in relative obscurity.</li>
            <li><strong>1969–1985</strong> – Lived quietly while stories of his actions gradually came to light, thanks to the efforts of survivors and their families.</li>
            <li><strong>1985</strong> – Honored by Israel’s Yad Vashem as one of the “Righteous Among the Nations” for risking his life and career to save Jews during the Holocaust.</li>
            <li><strong>1986</strong> – Passed away on July 31 in Kamakura, Japan; his legacy continues to inspire acts of moral courage and humanitarianism around the world.</li>
          </ul><br>
